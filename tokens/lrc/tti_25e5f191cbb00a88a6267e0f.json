        "en":"Loopring (LRC) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol offering orderbook-based trading infrastructure with anti-front-running, and zero-knowledge proof-based scaling technologies. This infrastructure consists of open source smart contracts, as well as off-chain matching and proving software. Loopring 3.0, leveraging zero knowledge proofs, reportedly allows for significant throughput increases of non-custodial exchanges while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum blockchain. Loopring also offers an auction protocol called Oedax (Open-Ended Dutch Auction Exchange). LRC is the protocol token that is used on Loopring and Oedax to incentivize network liquidity and optimize exchange/participant behaviour."
